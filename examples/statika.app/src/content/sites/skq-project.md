In 2004, a new substance was synthesized by the group of professor Vladimir P. Skulachev in the Moscow State 
University. Our project team later gave the substance its “production” name “SkQ1".  Two commercial 
entities Mitotech Russia and Mitotech EU were established around 2010 with an aim to 
develop SkQ1 into a drug targeting several age-related indications.
